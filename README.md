# Temperate-and-Humidity-with-ESP8266-DHT22-Sensor-L2C-OLED
SSD1306 128×64 Mono 0.96"  I2C OLED Display, DHT22 Temperature and Humidity  Sensor Module (AM2302),  ESP8266 NodeMcu V2 CP2102 , Breadboard and Male-to-Male Jumper Wires are required.

In this project, the integration of a DHT22 sensor is used for temperature and humidity measurements with an SSD1306 OLED display, utilizing an ESP8266 via the Arduino IDE. By employing the OLED display alongside the ESP8266, the aim is to demonstrate the creation of a user interface for the hardware setups. Specifically, a 128×64 OLED display interfaced via I2C for visual output will be utilized, while the DHT22 sensor will handle the task of capturing temperature and humidity data.

The OLED display to be utilized operates through the I2C communication protocol, requiring a connection to the appropriate I2C pins on the ESP8266.
Using an ESP8266, these default I2C pins configured were used: GPIO 5 (D1) as SCL, and GPIO 4 (D2) as SDA.
